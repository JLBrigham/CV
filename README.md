## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

I have built excellent client relationships both as a property manager and whilst working face-to-face with clients at the bed and breakfast I ran for two summers. There I built a collection of great ratings and reviews. To sucessfully work in operations it is vital to get colleagues from other teams on board with your ideas, plans and processes. I became a vauled member of the team, through engaging with my colleagues and taking time to understand their needs. To further advance my written communication skills, as well as improving my self-evaluation, I have started a blog during my Makers journey, take look here (link to blog)

#### Thrive under pressure

Working at the airport for Crystal Ski I consistently proved myself during crisis situations and was consequntly promoted to the airport management team. I became a team member that could step into any role and be relied on to 'get things done' whilst we faced huge operational obstacles. My resilance and abilty to keep calm were attributes I was regularly praised for by colleagues.

#### Logical thinker

Whilst at Crystal Ski I implimented a new process for tracking staff movements. I identified an area for improvement, analysed what not working and came up with ways the process could be improved efficiently. The process I put together was subsequently rolled out in our counterpart overseas offices.
