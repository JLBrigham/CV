## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Excellent communicator

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

Client facing roles. To further advance my written communication skills, as well as my self-evaluation skills, I have started a blog during my Makers journey. (link to blog)

#### Thrive under pressure

Working at the airport for Crystal Ski I consistently proved myself during crisis situations and was consequntly promoted to the airport management team. I became a team member that could step into any role and be relied on to 'get things done' whilst we faced huge operational obstacles. My resilance and abilty to keep calm were attributes I was regularly praised for by colleagues.

### Logical thinker

Whilst at Crystal Ski I implimented a new process for tracking staff movements. I identified an area for improvement, analysed what not working and came up with ways the process could be improved efficiently. The process I put together was subsequently rolled out in our counterpart overseas offices.
