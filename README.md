## Joanna Brigham 

As a full-stack junior developer who graduated from Makers Academy in April 2021, I am now excited to be looking for my first role in the tech industry. 

During this intensive 16 week bootcamp, I have gone from having basic Ruby programming skills to the ability to build a full stack mobile/web application. All whilst learning and understanding the importance of best coding practices and the value of writing high quality code. Seeing the progression I've made in this short space of time has taught me that with a growth mindset, I have all the skills needed to learn whatever I put my mind to. Whilst at Makers I particularly enjoyed pair-programming and working on group engineering projects. I have seen the huge benefits that come from working collaboratively and am excited that the tech industry provides an opportunity to work and develop my skills further in this way.

Since graudating from univeristy I have spent the majority of my time living and working overseas. I've been based in Chamonix, France for the past 4 years.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

I have built excellent client relationships both as a property manager and whilst working face-to-face with clients at the bed and breakfast I ran for two summers. There I built a collection of great ratings and reviews. To sucessfully work in operations it is vital to get colleagues from other teams on board with your ideas, plans and processes. I became a vauled member of the team, through engaging with my colleagues and taking time to understand their needs. To further advance my written communication skills, as well as improving my self-evaluation, I have started a blog during my Makers journey, take look here (link to blog)

#### Thrive under pressure

Working at the airport for Crystal Ski I consistently proved myself during crisis situations and was consequntly promoted to the airport management team. I became a team member that could step into any role and be relied on to 'get things done' whilst we faced huge operational obstacles. My resilance and abilty to keep calm were attributes I was regularly praised for by colleagues.

#### Logical thinker

Whilst at Crystal Ski I implimented a new process for tracking staff movements. I identified an area for improvement, analysed what not working and came up with ways the process could be improved efficiently. The process I put together was subsequently rolled out in our counterpart overseas offices.

#### Problem solving
